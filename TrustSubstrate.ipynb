        "### 🛡️ A Note on Intent\n",
        "**This experiment is not for sensationalization.** The goal is not to \"call out\" specific model vulnerabilities or claim a system is \"unsafe.\" Instead, it is a diagnostic study of **Policy Elasticity**, a property inherent to all probabilistic models. We use these traces to understand how to build better **Trust Infrastructure** around any model, regardless of the provider.\n",

        "* **A Prototype for Trust Measurement:** Moving beyond binary \"safe/unsafe\" labels toward continuous evaluation.\n",
        "* **A Longitudinal Study:** Demonstrating that trust is a trajectory, not a single point-in-time check.\n",
        "* **An Analysis of Policy Elasticity:** Observing how internal boundaries \"flicker\" or erode over multiple turns.\n",
